He who understands the concept well, writes it thus beautifully.

Similar to the saying that those who understand well can teach well, explain it well.
Taking two days to refactor the min_max function has made me come closer to understanding
the essentials things behind the concept. Thinking of the different ways I could write it
that would produce code that would be easy for one to understand what it going on.
This is also keeping in mind that I wanted to keep it light weight so that it would make it
easy to port it different turn based games.
